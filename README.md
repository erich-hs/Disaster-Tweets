<!-- ABOUT THE REPOSITORY -->
## About the Repository
This is a sandbox repository to try out and keep track of the best techniques for Natural Language Processing with deep neural networks.
Records from my first implementation of a neural network for a NLP classification task using Python and NumPy, to modern frameworks and architectures for sequential and language models.

* Low-level MLP with Numpy
* MLP with Tensorflow and Keras
* Bi-directional LSTM
* 1D Separable Convolution
* Dense classifier with a BERT_L-10_H-256 encoder
