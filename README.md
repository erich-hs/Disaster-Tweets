<!-- ABOUT THE REPOSITORY -->
## About the Repository
A repository to try out and keep track of the best techniques for Natural Language Processing with deep neural networks.
Records from my first implementation of a neural network using Python and NumPy to modern frameworks and architectures
such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) with TensorFlow.

Project in progress.
